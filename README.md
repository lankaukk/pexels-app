### Info about the React Components

#### `<App/>`

The top level component is be the `<App />` component. It is responsible for rendering the `<PicListContainer />` component.

#### `<PicListContainer />`

`<PicListContainer />` is a container that does data fetching and then renders its corresponding sub-component. 

#### `<PicList />`

`<PicList />` is a _presentational_ component. It receives data from its props
and renders html given the input data. It renders each image and the photographer's name within a link tag to that photographer's url.

#### `<PicSearchPaginate />`

The `<PicSearchPaginate />` component renders a form that receives the user input for the Pexels search. The text input is a _controlled component_ that
stores the value of the input in its component state and renders the DOM
accordingly. 

`<PicSearchPaginate />` receives a callback prop from its parent. On a submit event, it invokes that callback prop with the value of the text input. It is this callback function, defined in `<PicListContainer />`, that actually querys the API with the text the user entered.
